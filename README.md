## About Me

Hi, I’m Utsav — a developer from India, currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science in Germany. I specialize in building intuitive web interfaces with **React.js** and am gaining hands-on experience with **Java (Spring Boot)** on the backend. While I have a strong foundation in this stack, I’m always eager to explore and work with other technologies across the full stack.

## Tech Stack (So Far)

**Frontend:**
- React.js, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS

**Backend:**
- Java, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, REST APIs, PostgreSQL, MySQL

**Tools & Workflow:**
- Git, GitHub, Postman, Docker (learning), JUnit, Linux, CI/CD (learning)

> I'm adaptable and open to learning new frameworks, languages, and tools based on project needs.

## What I'm Working On

- Building modular, scalable frontend apps with **React**
- Deepening backend expertise with **Spring Boot**
